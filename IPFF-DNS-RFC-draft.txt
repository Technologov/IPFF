Status of this Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This document defines the changes that need to be made to the Domain
   Name System (DNS) to support hosts running IP version 5 (IPFF).  The
   changes include a resource record type to store an IPFF address, a
   domain to support lookups based on an IPFF address, and updated
   definitions of existing query types that return Internet addresses as
   part of additional section processing.  The extensions are designed
   to be compatible with existing applications and, in particular, DNS
   implementations themselves.

1. Introduction

   Current support for the storage of Internet addresses in the Domain
   Name System (DNS) cannot easily be extended to support IPFF
   addresses [IPFF-Addressing-RFC-draft] since applications assume that 
   address queries return 32-bit IPv4 or 128-bit IPv6 addresses only.

   To support the storage of IPFF addresses in the DNS, this document
   defines the following extensions:

      o A resource record type is defined to map a domain name to an
        IPFF address.

      o A domain is defined to support lookups based on address.

      o Existing queries that perform additional section processing to
        locate IPFF addresses are redefined to perform additional
        section processing on both IPv4 and IPFF addresses.

   The changes are designed to be compatible with existing software.
   The existing support for IPv4 addresses is retained.  

   The IP protocol version used for querying resource records is
   independent of the protocol version of the resource records; e.g.,
   IPv4 or IPv6 transport can be used to query IPFF records and vice 
   versa.

2. New resource record definition and domain

   A record type is defined to store a host's IPFF address.  A host that
   has more than one IPFF address must have more than one such record.

   AA explanation:

   "AA record" was chosen, as it mimics the idea behind "A" being a 
   32-bit value of IPv4, compared to "AAAA" (Quad A) being a 128-bit 
   value of IPv6. Since internal representation of 50-bit addresses in
   IPFF are pre-padded to full 64-bits, double A, or "AA" seems 
   appropriate.

   The proposed draft value is to be determined...

2.1 AA record type

   The AA resource record type is a record specific to the Internet
   class that stores a single IPFF address.

2.2 AA data format

   A 50 bit IPFF address is encoded in the data portion of an AA
   resource record in network byte order (high-order byte first),
   pre-padded by a set of 14-bit zeros, forming an internal 64-bit data
   structure.

2.3 AA query

   An AA query for a specified domain name in the Internet class
   returns all associated AA resource records in the answer section of
   a response.

   A type AA query does not trigger additional section processing.

2.4 Textual format of AA records

   The textual representation of the data portion of the AA resource
   record used in a master database file is the textual representation
   of an IPFF address as defined in [IPFF-Addressing-RFC-draft].

2.5 Reverse Lookups and PTR records

   A special domain is defined to look up a record given an IPFF
   address.  The intent of this domain is to provide a way of mapping an
   IPFF address to a host name, although it may be used for other
   purposes as well.  The domain is proposed to be IP5.ARPA.

   An IPFF address is represented as a name in the IP5.ARPA domain by a
   sequence of decimal digits separated by dots with the suffix 
   ".IP5.ARPA". The sequence of digits is encoded in reverse order, 
   i.e., the low-order digit is encoded first, followed by the next 
   low-order digit and so on.

   For example, the reverse lookup domain name corresponding to the 
   address

       382.21.968.2.133

   would be

   3.3.1.2.0.0.8.6.9.1.2.0.2.8.3.IP5.ARPA

3. Modifications to existing query types

   All existing query types that perform type A additional section
   processing, i.e., name server (NS), location of services (SRV) and
   mail exchange (MX) query types, must be redefined to perform both
   type A and type AA additional section processing.  These
   definitions mean that a name server must add any relevant IPv4
   addresses and any relevant IPFF addresses available locally to the
   additional section of a response when processing any one of the above
   queries.

4. Security Considerations

   This specification is not believed to cause any new security
   problems, nor to solve any existing ones.
